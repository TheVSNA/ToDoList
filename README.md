# ToDoList

This is a simple Todo list application that lets the user:
* Add and remove todo elements, specifying:
  * the date
  * some tags (like: personal projects, family, ecc.)
  * a level of urgency (Very urgent, Urgent, Not urgent)
  * the text of the todo
* Visualize the todo elements filtering by:
  * date
  * tag
  * urgency
* Check off the things already done

This was just an experiment to try and test some elements of javafx, reading and writing from file, classes.
